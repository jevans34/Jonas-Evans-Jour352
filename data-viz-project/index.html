    <h1>Big 3 Grand Slam Wins (2006-2021) </h1>
    <h2>Broken Down By Tournament</h2>
    <h3>By Jonas Evans</h3>
    <p>Grand Slams are the four most important tournaments of the ATP season. The Big 3 lead all other players in Grand Slam wins, however their win breakdowns are very different. Nadal was dominant in France, while Djokovic had much more success in Australia. Federer, of course, made his mark as the king of grass at Wimbledon.</p>
